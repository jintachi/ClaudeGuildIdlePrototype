- **Signal System**: Event notifications, state changes

## üìù **Current System Analysis**

### **Existing Components**
- ‚úÖ Basic `Inventory` class with slot management
- ‚úÖ `InventoryItem` class with basic properties
- ‚úÖ Room-specific item filters in current inventory
- ‚úÖ Save/load functionality for inventory data

### **Integration Patterns**
- ‚úÖ Rooms access GuildManager directly for resources
- ‚úÖ BaseRoom class provides common room functionality
- ‚úÖ Signal system for room and state changes
- ‚úÖ Centralized resource management in GuildManager

### **Areas for Improvement**
- üîÑ Convert inventory to singleton pattern (like GuildManager)
- üîÑ Enhance item properties and categorization
- üîÑ Improve room-specific inventory access
- üîÑ Add advanced inventory management features
- üîÑ Integrate with equipment and character systems

This modular approach ensures that the inventory system enhances every room while maintaining clean separation of concerns and allowing for easy expansion and modification.
